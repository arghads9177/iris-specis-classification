# Iris Species Classification

## Project Overview

The **Iris dataset** is one of the most famous datasets in the field of machine learning. It was originally used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper *The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems*. This dataset contains 150 samples from three different species of Iris flowers: *Iris-setosa*, *Iris-versicolor*, and *Iris-virginica*, with four features recorded for each sample.

The objective of this project is to build a classification model that predicts the species of an Iris flower based on the given features, using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following columns:

- **Id**: Unique identifier for each sample.
- **SepalLengthCm**: Sepal length of the flower in centimeters.
- **SepalWidthCm**: Sepal width of the flower in centimeters.
- **PetalLengthCm**: Petal length of the flower in centimeters.
- **PetalWidthCm**: Petal width of the flower in centimeters.
- **Species**: The species of the flower (*Iris-setosa*, *Iris-versicolor*, or *Iris-virginica*).

### Summary:

- **Number of Observations**: 150
- **Number of Features**: 5 (4 features + 1 target variable)

## Objective

The goal of this project is to:

1. Understand and visualize the dataset.
2. Train a classification model to accurately predict the species of Iris flowers based on the four features.
3. Evaluate the performance of different classification models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Visualize the data to understand the distribution of features for each species.
   - Analyze the relationships between different features using scatter plots, pair plots, and correlation matrices.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle any missing values (though none are present in this dataset).
   - Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
   
3. **Model Training**:
   - Build and train classification the model using algorithms such as:
     - XGBClassifier
   
4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the models using appropriate classification metrics:
     - **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly classified instances.
     - **Precision**: The proportion of predicted positives that are actually positive.
     - **Recall**: The proportion of actual positives that are correctly predicted.
     - **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
     - **Confusion Matrix**: To visualize the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

## Model Performance Metrics

- **Accuracy**: Measures how often the classifier makes the correct predictions.
- **Precision and Recall**: Evaluate the performance when dealing with imbalanced classes (though this dataset is balanced).
- **F1-Score**: Useful when balancing precision and recall.
- **Confusion Matrix**: To visualize how well the model performed in each class.

## Visualizations

Here are some suggested visualizations to explore the Iris dataset:

1. **Scatter Plots**: Compare the distribution of features like Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width across different species.
2. **Pair Plots**: Show pairwise relationships between features.
3. **Heatmaps**: Show the correlation between features.
4. **Box Plots**: Display the distribution of features for each species.
